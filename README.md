# PseudocodeCompiler
A Program that compiles Pseudocode into Java.

This program was created to complete my Honors Learning Experience for the Spring Semester of 2022.
It will take a pseudocode document, as marked at https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/pseudocode/pseudocodeguide.php
and compile it into Java code.


### Usage:

`java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar (jarname).jar java path/to/file.pseudo`



### Example Usage:

`java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar java examples/Objects.pseudo`


There are a few example files in this repository that could be used from testing. Anything not made by me has a link to the original posting.
